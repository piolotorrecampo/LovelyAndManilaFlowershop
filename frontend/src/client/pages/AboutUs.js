          started with just 2 employees, naming the founder Benjamin Arenas and

          carts that would be pushed all around Marikina City, as time went on
          they were able to occupy a small space near Freedom Park in Marikina,
          until today where they are now located near Marikina City jail were
          their shop is now managed by their youngest daughter Lovely Arenas and
          has now 7 employees working for them.Â
